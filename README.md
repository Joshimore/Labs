# Repo description
*Use git every day! To be happy! ~~but now i gonna have a rest~~* 
Before then, I had already made a mess of my repository and I didnâ€™t know about things called documentation where one can get understanding of any tool or technology before using it. Once I heard about it, I delved into git and GitHub documentation, I studied about git commands which include; git init, git clone, git pull amongst others. I also looked at branching and the branch-naming conventions and with the help of friends and colleagues, I got to understand pull request and branch merging.
